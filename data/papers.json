Comparative experiments show that\r\nthe proposed method has strong applicability and high visualization eect for data with complex characteristics, data weight\r\nprobability conforms to the expected value and Gaussian distribution, and the overall performance of the platform is excellent.",

Weiser et al. and others have suggested\r\nthat this may be accomplished by a CPU which dynamically changes speed and voltage, thereby saving energy\r\nby spreading run cycles into idle time. Here we continue\r\nthis research, using a simulation to compare a number of\r\npolicies for dynamic speed-setting. Our work clarifies a\r\nfundamental power vs. delay tradeoff, as well as the role\r\nof prediction and of smoothing in dynamic speed-setting\r\npolicies. We conclude that success seemingly depends\r\nmore on simple smoothing algorithms than on sophisticated prediction techniques, but defer to the replication\r\nof these results on future variable-speed systems.",
